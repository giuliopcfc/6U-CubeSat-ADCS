# Attitude Determination and Control of a 6U CubeSat
_Design_, _modeling_, and _simulation_ of the ADCS of a 6U Cubesat equipped with:
* a star sensor,
* a gyroscope,
* a reaction wheel,
* three magnetic coils.

The model includes:
* the environmental disturbing torques (gravity gradient, magnetic field, drag, and solar radiation pressure),
* the noise affecting the sensors,
* the dynamics of the actuators.

Three control modes are simulated: _de-tumbling_, _slew maneuver_, and _Earth pointing_. The performance of the control laws is analyzed in both nominal and off-nominal conditions.


The project is realized in MATLAB and Simulink.
